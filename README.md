# C_B: custom_blender.py 

+ Do you work with blender? 
- that perfect tool for 3d modeling?
+ Yes exaclly! how should i learn writing python codes in that? 
+ the bpy python codes are to long and hard to remmember :(
- Dont be worry look what i have found! c_b!

 C_B, this cute face can make your job so much faster than past 
 and you can learn blender by python very easier even than graphic!!


do you still write like this? 
```python
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=3, location=(0,0,0)
```

why you dont try this:
```python
cube()
```

do you remove all objects in 3 lines? why?
do it in one line:
```python
remove('all')
```

## if you dont know blender and just python, its very simple to undrstand the simple things and coding
you can use print(help(cube)) to see the every func doc

it will have a huge update with minimum size, be ready for it!
featurs :
+ adding object by one line
+ creating function return that object so you will not lose your time in select and find the object
+ simple and easy removing (all or just a verible or name of object)


more in the way ...
